# Detection of age word problems in publically available datasets
Analysed popular math word problem (MWP) datasets: ALG514, SingleEQ, Common Core, All-Arith, Illinois and
Dolphin datasets for the presence of age word problems (ageWPs).
Different ML approaches like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Word2Vec,
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long short term memory (LSTM) were used.
